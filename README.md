# Wrangling WeRate Dogs Dataset

## by Samuel Tsuma


## Introduction

In this project, we will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing)
the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous
comment about the dog. The focus of this project is on the assessing and
cleaning stages.

## Summary of Gathering

Data is gathered from three different sources as follows:

Directly download the WeRateDogs Twitter archive data (twitter_archive_enhanced.csv)
Use the Requests library to download the tweet image prediction (image_predictions.tsv)
Use the Tweepy library to query additional data via the Twitter API (tweet_json.txt)

## Summary of  wrangling and cleaning

At Least eight quality and two tidiness issues were detected and documented
as per the project requirements. However, there may have been more issues 
with the datasets needing to be addressed.

## Summary of Findings

Based on the analysis, the puppo is the most popular(retweets), most loved
(saved as favourite) and highest rated dog(ratings), followed by the doggo
and the floofer comes in third in popularity, ratings and favour. The pupper
on the other hand doesn't seem to get as much attention as the three. 
We could conclude that most people adore puppos.
